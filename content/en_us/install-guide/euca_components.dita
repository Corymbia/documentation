	<title>Eucalyptus Components</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus is comprised of the following components: Cloud Controller (CLC),
		User-Facing Services (UFS), Object Storage Gateway (OSG), Cluster Controller (CC), Storage
		Controller (SC), Node Controller (NC) and an optional VMware Broker (Broker or
		VB).</shortdesc>

		<!--	<p>The following image shows the interconnectivity of the Eucalyptus components.</p>-->

		<p>A detailed description of each Eucalyptus component follows.</p>
		<section><title>Cloud Controller</title>
			<p>In most deployments, the CLC and the UFS are on the same machine. This machine is the
				entry-point into the cloud for administrators, developers, project managers, and
				end-users. The CLC handles persistence and is the backend for the UFS.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>User-Facing Services</title>
			<p>The UFS serve as endpoints for the AWS-compatible services offered by Eucalyptus: EC2
				(compute), AS (AutoScaling), CW (CloudWatch), ELB (LoadBalancing), IAM (Euare), and
				STS (tokens).</p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Object Storage Gateway</title>
			<p>The OSG passes requests to object storage providers and talks to the persistence
				layer (DB) to authenticate requests. You can use Walrus or Riak CS as the object
				storage provider. </p></section>
		<section><title>Cluster Controller</title>
			<p>The Cluster Controller (CC) generally executes on a machine that has network
				connectivity to both the machines running the Node Controllers (NCs) and to the
				machine running the CLC. CCs gather information about a set of NCs and schedules
				virtual machine (VM) execution on specific NCs. The CC also manages the virtual
				machine networks in Managed and Managed (No VLAN) <xref
					href="planning_networking_modes.dita">networking modes</xref>. All NCs
				associated with a single CC must be in the same subnet.</p></section>
		<section><title>Storage Controller</title>
			<p>The Storage Controller (SC) provides functionality similar to the Amazon Elastic
				Block Store (Amazon EBS). The SC can interface with various storage systems. Elastic
				block storage exports storage volumes that can be attached by a VM and mounted or
				accessed as a raw block device. EBS volumes persist past VM termination and are
				commonly used to store persistent data. An EBS volume cannot be shared between VMs
				and can only be accessed within the same availability zone in which the VM is
				running. Users can create snapshots from EBS volumes. Snapshots are stored in Walrus
				and made available across availability zones. Eucalyptus with SAN support lets you
				use your enterprise-grade SAN devices to host EBS storage within a Eucalyptus
				cloud.</p></section>
		<section><title>Node Controller</title>
			<p>The Node Controller (NC) executes on any machine that hosts VM instances. The NC
				controls VM activities, including the execution, inspection, and termination of VM
				instances. It also fetches and maintains a local cache of instance images, and it
				queries and controls the system software (host OS and the hypervisor) in response to
				queries and control requests from the CC. The NC manages the virtual machine
				networks in Edge <xref href="planning_networking_modes.dita">networking mode</xref>.
				The NC is also responsible for the management of the virtual network
			endpoint.</p></section>
		<section><title>VMware Broker</title>
			<note importance="deprecated">Support for VMWare features in Eucalyptus has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</note>
			<p>VMware Broker (Broker or VB) is an optional Eucalyptus component, which is available
				if you are a Eucalyptus subscriber. VMware Broker enables Eucalyptus to deploy
				virtual machines (VMs) on VMware infrastructure elements. VMware Broker mediates all
				interactions between the CC and VMware hypervisors (ESX/ESXi) either directly or
				through VMware vCenter.</p></section>
