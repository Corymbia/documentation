    <title>Live Instance Migration to RHEL 7</title>
    <shortdesc>This topic describes a live instance (VM) migration from a RHEL 6 NC to a RHEL 7 NC,
        with little or no service interruption.</shortdesc>

<!--    If there are no prereqs, state "None." -->        
        <prereq><b>Prerequisites</b>
            <p>Before live instance migration, ensure that you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the risks of live migration, as described in <xref
                        href="upgrade_rhel6_rhel7.dita#upgrade_rhel6_rhel7"/>.</li>
                <li>Have successfully backed up your <ph
                        conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> cloud state.</li>
                <li>Have an available host machine for the destination NC.</li>
