			<title>Redundant Physical Servers for Eucalyptus Components</title>
			<p>Each cloud component (CLC and OSG) and cluster component (CC and SC) in an HA deployment has a
				redundant hot backup. These redundant Eucalyptus components occur in pairs, and each
				member of a pair must be mapped to a separated physical server to ensure high
				availability. </p>
			<note type="important">HA pairs must be able to connect to each
				other.</note>
			<p>If the HA deployment is to be able to tolerate the failure of networking hardware, additional
				network interfaces are required for the physical servers that host Eucalyptus
				components. The physical servers hosting a CLC, Walrus, or CC must each have three
				network interface cards (NICs). Each remaining physical server (except the NC
				components) requires two NICs.</p>
			<p>The following image shows a two-cluster deployment with the
				component pairs at the cloud and cluster level. The NCs are not
				redundant.</p>

		<section>
			<title>DNS Round-Robin Support</title>
			<p>The DNS entries for the externally visible IP addresses of the
				physical servers hosting CLC or Walrus components must be
				configured to change round-robin style in an HA deployment.</p>
		</section>

		<section><title>Storage Mirroring</title>
			<p>HA Eucalyptus uses a kernel-level storage technology called DRBD
				for storage integrity. DRBD must be configured to mirror data
				operations between physical servers that host Walrus components.
				For more information about DRBD, go to <xref
					href="http://www.drbd.org/" format="html" type="external"
					>What is DRBD</xref>.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Storage Controllers</title>
			<p>For HA Storage Controllers, you must be using a supported SAN.
				Only use HA SCs with NetApp or Equallogic drivers, not with the
				iSCSI or JBOD SC driver.</p>
		</section>

		<!--<section><title>Email Notification</title>
			<p>HA Eucalyptus notifies the system administrator of failure events via email. The Linux MTA
				(Mail Transfer Agent) must be configured to deliver these notifications on any machine
				hosting a CLC component in an HA Eucalyptus deployment.</p></section>-->
