    <title>Back Up the <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> Cloud State Before OS Upgrade</title>
    <shortdesc>This topic describes the special circumstances for backing up during an upgrade of
            <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>
        <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version_short"/> to <ph
            conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> and from RHEL 6 to RHEL 7.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
<!--    If there are no prereqs, state "None." -->        
        <prereq><b>Prerequisites</b>
            <p>Before starting the cloud state backup, ensure that you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upgraded each existing <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> host
                    machine from <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version_short"/> to
                    <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> while the OS is still
                    RHEL 6.</li>
                <li>Verified that all <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> services
                    are enabled and running on <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>
                    release version <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/>.</li>
<!--                <li>ANYTHING ELSE ???</li>
-->            </ul>
        </prereq>        
<!--    This "To ... " context states what we are trying to accomplish via the steps in this task. -->        
        <context>
            <p>You now have <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>
                <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> running on all RHEL 6 hosts, but
                this is only an interim state. To reach the supported configuration, you will soon
                perform a clean install of RHEL 7, and then a clean install of <ph
                    conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>
                <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> on the hosts.</p>
            <p>Because you will be wiping out the OS and <ph
                    conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>, you must back up the
                configuration state of your cloud beforehand.</p>
            <p>The upgrade to <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/>
                <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> on RHEL 6 was required so that
                the <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> code can properly back up
                your cloud state, which can then be restored after the clean install of <ph
                    conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> on RHEL 7 hosts.</p>
