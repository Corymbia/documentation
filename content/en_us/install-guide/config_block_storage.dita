    <title>Configure Block Storage</title>
    <shortdesc>This topic describes how to configure block storage on the Storage Controller (SC) 
        for the backend of your choice.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>The Storage Controller (SC) provides functionality similar to the Amazon Elastic
                Block Store (Amazon EBS). The SC can interface with various storage systems.
                <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> block storage (EBS) exports storage volumes that can be attached by a VM
                and mounted or accessed as a raw block device. EBS volumes can persist past VM
                termination and are commonly used to store persistent data.</p>
            <p><ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> provides the following open source (free) backend providers for the SC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Overlay</b> - using the local file system</li>
                <li><b>Direct Attached Storage</b> - DAS-JBOD (just a bunch of disks)</li>
                <li><b>Ceph-RBD</b> - leverages RADOS block device; this backend provider includes
                    snapshot delta support</li>
            </ul>
            <p><ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> also offers the following subscription-based (paid) storage area network
                (SAN) backend providers for the SC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>HP 3PAR</b> - StorageServ storage systems</li>
                <li><b>NetApp</b> - Clustered Data ONTAP and 7-mode storage systems</li>
                <li><b>Dell EqualLogic</b> - stacked or unstacked storage arrays</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You must configure the SC to use one of the backend provider options.</p>
