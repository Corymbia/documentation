 <title>Midokura Enterprise MidoNet Component Topology</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>The following section lists topology recommendations for installing Midokura Enterprise MidoNet.</p>
  <note importance="high">See <xref href="preparing_vpc_midonet.dita"/> for more
   information on MidoNet.</note>
  <ul>
   <li>The midonet-api must run co-located with the Eucalyptus Cloud Controller (CC)</li>
   <li>Each Node Controller (NC) must run a Midolman agent</li>
   <li>The Cloud Controller (CC) must run a Midolman agent</li>
   <li>It is recommended that your User Facing Services (UFS) host be used as the MidoNet Gateway (i.e.
    running a Midolman agent) when configuring Eucalyptus</li>
   <li>The MidoNet Gateway will take over which ever interface Eucalyptus GatewayInterface is
    configured for and block traffic that is not to/from MidoNet.<ul>
       <li>If you only have 1 interface on your host then you need to follow the instructions from
        Midokura on setting up a veth pair so that MidoNet can take over a virtual interface rather
        than a physical one, as in this example (skip step 6 for Eucalyptus installs):
