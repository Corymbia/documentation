			<p>You can only upgrade to Eucalyptus <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/>
				from <ph
					conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version"/> or from the prescribed paths below. 
				To upgrade from any other version of Eucalyptus, you must first upgrade to <ph
			conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version"/>. Follow the
			directions in that version's Installation Guide in the <xref
				href="https://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/documentation/archive" scope="external"
				format="html">documentation archives</xref>, and then upgrade to <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/>
				using the directions in this section.</p>
		<p>You do not need to shutdown instances in order to upgrade. However, Auto Scaling instances will
			likely shut down and be replaced, based on each group's scaling policy and health check criteria.</p>
		
		<note type="tip">If you want to upgrade from a release prior to 3.4.3, follow a prescribed upgrade path as shown:
			<ul>
				<li>Upgrade from 3.1.2 -> 3.2.2</li>
				<li>Upgrade from 3.2.2 -> 3.3.2</li>
				<li>Upgrade from 3.3.2 -> 3.4.3</li>
				<li>Upgrade from 3.4.3 -> 4.0.2</li>
			</ul>
		</note>    
			
			<note type="important">Eucalyptus does not support components that are at different releases,
				even at the sub-minor level. For
				example, you cannot have a CLC at <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> and a Walrus at <ph
					conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version"/>. Please
				make sure that you update all Eucalyptus components when you
			        upgrade.</note>
