	<shortdesc>This topic describes ways you can install Eucalyptus services on your physical
		servers.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can run Eucalyptus services in any combination on the various physical servers in a data
			center. You can install the Cloud Controller, Walrus, CC, and SC on one host machine,
			and an NC on one or more host machines. Or you can install each service on an
			independent physical server. This gives each service its own local resources. </p>
		<p>Often in installation decisions, you must trade deployment simplicity for performance. For
			example, if you place all cloud and cluster services on a single machine, it makes for
			simple administration. This is because there is only one machine to monitor and control
			for the Eucalyptus control services. But, each service acts as an independent web
			service. So if they share a single machine, the physical resources available to each
			service might become a performance bottleneck. </p>
