            <term>Object storage</term>
            <p><ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> provides an AWS S3 compatible object storage service
                that provides users with web-based general purpose storage, designed to be scalable,
                reliable and inexpensive. You choose the object storage backend provider: Walrus or
                Riak. The Object Storage Gateway (OSG) provides access to objects via the backend
                provider you choose.</p>

            <term>Block storage</term>
            <p><ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product"/> provides an AWS EBS compatible block storage service that provides block
                storage for EC2 instances. Volumes can be created as needed and dynamically attached
                and detached to instances as required. EBS provides persistent data storage for
                instances: the volume, and the data on it, can exist beyond the lifetime of an
                instance. You choose the block storage backend provider, which can be using freely
                available resources in your cloud, or via a SAN, if you have a subscription
                (paid).</p>
