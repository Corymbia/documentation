	<shortdesc>This topic describes ways you can install Eucalyptus components on your machines.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can run Eucalyptus components in any
			combination on the various physical servers in a data center.  You can install the Cloud Controller,
			Walrus, CC, and SC on one machine, and an NC on one or more
			machines. Or you can install each component on an independent
			physical server. This gives each component the most local resource
			usage. </p>
		<p>Often in installation decisions, you must trade deployment simplicity for performance. For
			example, if you place all cloud and cluster components on a single machine, it makes for
			simple administration. This is because there is only one machine to monitor and control
			for the Eucalyptus control services. But, each component acts as an independent web
			service. So if these components share a single machine, the physical resources available
			to each service could become a performance bottleneck. </p>
