		<section>
			<title>Cloud Components</title>
			<p>The main decision for cloud components is whether to install the Cloud Controller (CLC)
				and Walrus on the same server. If they are on the same server, they
				operate as separate web services within a single Java environment,
				and they use a fast-path for inter-service communication. If they
				are not on the same server, they use SOAP and REST to work
				together.</p>
			<p>However, when installed on the same server, the CLC and Walrus must
				share a common memory footprint, both managed by the Java memory
				manager. Walrus self-tunes its performance based on the memory
				pressure it perceives and runs faster with more memory. So, while
				separating the CLC and Walrus decreases the efficiency of the
				messaging between the two, it often increases the responsiveness of
				the overall Eucalyptus system when Walrus is given a large memory
				footprint.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the key factor for cloud components is not performance, but
				server cost and data center configuration. If you only have one
				server available for the cloud, then you have to install the
				components on the same server.</p>
			<p>The CLC and Walrus components are not designed to be separated by
				wide-area, common carrier networks. They use aggressive time-outs to
				maintain system responsiveness so separating them over a
				long-latency, lossy network link will not work.</p>
			<p>The CLC and Walrus communicate with Eucalyptus clients independently.
				End-users typically interact with Eucalyptus through a client
				interface. They can use either our provided euca2ools Linux command
				line client tools, or the Eucalyptus AWS-compatible API, or a
				third-party client that is compatible with Eucalyptus. In all cases,
				the end-user client must be able to send messages via TCP/IP to the
				machine on which the CLC is deployed.</p>
			<p>In addition, the CLC must have TCP/IP connectivity to all other
				Eucalyptus components except for node controllers (NCs), which may
				reside on their own private networks. In addition, NC servers must
				be able to send messages to the Walrus server because images are
				downloaded by the NC using the Walrus URL. That is, the CLC does not
				need to be able to route network traffic directly to the NCs but
				Walrus does for the purposes of image delivery.</p>

		<section>
			<title>Cluster Components</title>
			<p>The Eucalyptus components deployed in the cluster level of a
				Eucalyptus deployment are the Cluster Controller (CC), Storage
				Controller (SC), and VMware Broker.</p>
			<note importance="deprecated">Support for VMWare features in Eucalyptus have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</note>
			<note type="tip">The VMware Broker is available by subscription only.
				You do not need the VMware Broker unless you are using VMware
				hypervisor.</note>
			<p>You can install all cluster components on a single machine, or you
				can distribute them on different machines. The choice of one or
				multiple machines is dictated by the demands of user workload in
				terms of external network utilization (CC) and EBS volume access
				(SC). </p>
			
			<p>Things to consider for CC placement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For Managed and Managed (No VLAN) modes, the CC
					physical machine becomes a software IP gateway between VM
					instances and the public network. Because of this software
					routing function, the physical server on which the CC is
					deployed should have fast, dedicated network access to both the
					NC network, and the public network. </li>
				<li>For Edge mode, the CC physical machine will not act as a software gateway. Network traffic
					will be limited to small control messages. </li>
				<li>In all cases, place the CC on a machine that has TCP/IP
					connectivity to the Eucalyptus front end servers and the NC
					servers in its cluster.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>Things to consider for SC placement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The machine on which the SC is deployed must always have TCP/IP
					connectivity to the CLC. If you are a subscriber and use one of
					Eucalyptus’ provided SAN integration drivers, the SC must also
					have TCP/IP connectivity to the chosen SAN device. In this case,
					the SC only sends control messages to the SAN. </li>
				<li>If you do not configure a SAN, the SC requires only TCP/IP
					connectivity to the NCs in the cluster. The SC will use this
					TCP/IP connectivity to provide the NCs network access to the
					dynamic block volumes residing on the SC’s storage. SC storage
					should consist of a fast, reliable disk pool (either local
					file-system or block-attached storage) so that the SC can create
					and maintain volumes for the NCs. The capacity of the disk pool
					should be sufficient to provide the NCs with enough space to
					accommodate all dynamic block volumes requests from
					end-users</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<title>Node Components</title>
			<p>The Node Controllers are the components that comprise the Eucalyptus
				back-end. All NCs must have network connectivity to whatever hosts their EBS
				volumes. This host is either a SAN or the SC.</p>
