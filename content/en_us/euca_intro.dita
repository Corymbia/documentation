  <p>Eucalyptus provides a management console, which is an intuitive web page that allows users to
   perform a vaiety of tasks, such as launching instances, define network and security settings, and
   specify storage needs through volumes and snapshots. Alternatively, users may issue advanced
   commands through a Command Line Interface (CLI) using a supported toolset, called Euca2ools, as well as 
   industry-standard AWS APIs, including EC2, S3, EBS, IAM, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and CloudWatch.
   Scripts and APIs may be used to automate repetitive or ongoing tasks to reduce unecessary burden
   on cloud administrators, freeing them up to tend to other priorities their organizations require.  </p>
  
  <p>Eucalyptus can dynamically scale up or down depending on application workloads and is uniquely suited 
   for enterprise clouds, delivering production-ready software. The benefits of open source software for private
   clouds are highly efficient scalability, organization agility, and increased trust and control for IT.</p>
