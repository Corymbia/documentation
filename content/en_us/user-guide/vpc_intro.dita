	<title>Using Virtual Private Cloud</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an implementation of Amazon VPC that allows you to define a logically isolated
		virtual network that can contain Eucalyptus resources. A virtual network enhances security by allowing you to have fine-grained, explicit 
	control over network gateways, subnets, IP address ranges, and inbound and outbound connectivity. This section of the User Guide 
	covers how Eucalyptus VPC works and how to use it.</shortdesc>
