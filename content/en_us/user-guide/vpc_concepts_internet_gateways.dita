 <title>Understanding Internet Gateways</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>An Internet gateway is an object that runs inside of your VPC and provides communication
   between VPC instances and the Internet. </p>
  <p>To use an Internet gateway in your VPC, you attach the gateway to your VPC, make sure your
   route tables direct Internet traffic to the Internet gateway, and configure your security groups
   to allow traffic through.</p>
  <p>For an instance to be able to communicate with the Internet gateway, it must have an associated
   public IP address. The default VPC comes with a pre-configured Internet gateway, and all
   instances that are launched into the default subnet receive a public IP address, so these
   instances have Internet access. </p>
