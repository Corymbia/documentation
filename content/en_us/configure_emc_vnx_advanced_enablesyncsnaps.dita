    <title>Configure EMC VNX Synchronous Snapshots</title>

    <shortdesc/>

    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Setting the <codeph>&lt;partition&gt;.storage.enablesyncsnaps</codeph> property to
                    <codeph>true</codeph> will cause snapshots to be set synchronously during a
                    <codeph>euca-create-snapshot</codeph> operation. In this mode,if the CLC loses a
                connection with the SC or if the connection times out (the default timeout is 60
                seconds), the SC will detect the connection has been closed and will mark the
                snapshot as failed and will clean up. This detection occurs after the VNX snapshot
                has been created, but before it initiates the thread that does the asynchronous
                migration and transfer of the snapshot LUN to Walrus.</p>
