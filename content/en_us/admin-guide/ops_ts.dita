 <title>Troubleshooting</title>
 <shortdesc>This topic details how to find information you need to troubleshoot most problems in
 	your cloud.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>Make sure you understand the mapping between the Eucalyptus components:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Cloud Controller (CLC)</li>
 			<li>User-facing services (UFS)</li>
 			<li>Walrus</li>
 			<li>Storage Controller (SC)</li>
 			<li>Cluster Controller (CC)</li>
 			<li>Node Controller (NC)</li>
 			<li>VMware Broker (only if you use VMware)</li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>For most problems, the procedure for tracing problems is the same: start at the bottom to
 			verify the bottom-most component, and then work your way up. If you do this, you can be assured
 			that the base is solid. This applies to virtually all Eucalyptus components and also works for proactive, targeted monitoring.</p>
