		<p>The
			administration CLI is installed when you install Eucalyptus
			server-side components. The administration CLI is for maintaining
			and modifying Eucalyptus.</p>
		<p>The other user CLI, called Euca2ools, can be downloaded and installed
			on clients. Euca2ools is a set of commands for end users and can be used with both
			Eucalyptus and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
		<draft-comment author="mereditk">Need to sync up the various credential-related topics, across the
			doc set. DOC-1987 improvement suggestion from Garrett for the Admin Guide and would be
			an XREF from Install Guide credentials_admin_create topic, as a suggested alternative
			admin role. BELOW hidden note about defunct eucarc:</draft-comment>
		<!--<p>The commands used in this guide assume that the environment variables
			exported by a eucarc file for an administrative Eucalyptus user have
			been set. For more information, see the <xref

				Guide</xref>.</p>-->
