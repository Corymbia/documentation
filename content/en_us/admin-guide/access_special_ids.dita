	<title>Special Identities</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus has two special identities for the convenience of
		administration and use of the system.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>

		<ul>
			<li>The <b>eucalyptus</b> account: Each user in the eucalyptus
				account has unrestricted access to all of the cloud's resources,
				similar to the superuser on a typical Linux system. These users
				are often referred to as system administrators or cloud
				administrators. This account is automatically created when the
				system starts for the first time. You cannot remove the
				eucalyptus account from the system.</li>
			<li>The <b>admin</b> user of an account: Each account, including the
				eucalyptus account, has a user named admin. This user is created
				automatically by the system when an account is created. The
				admin of an account has full access to the resources owned by
				the account. You can not remove the admin user from an account.
				The admin can delegate resource access to other users in the
				account by using policies.</li>
		</ul>
