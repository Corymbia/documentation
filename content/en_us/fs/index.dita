 <conbody>
 	<p>Welcome to the FastStart Guide. This guide provides instructions for installing
 		Eucalyptus in two different configurations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cloud-in-a-box: a Eucalyptus cloud with all components on a single machine</li>
			<li>Frontend and Node Controllers: a Eucalyptus cloud with all Frontend
				components on a single system, and one or more Node Controllers
				on separate machines</li>
		</ul>
 	<section>
 		<title>Overview</title>
 		<p>Eucalyptus consists of the following components:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Cloud Controller (CLC): this component provides EC2 functionality</li>
 			<li>Walrus: this component provides S3 functionality</li>
 			<li>Cluster Controller (CC): this component provides management service for a cluster in your
 				cloud</li>
 			<li>Storage Controller (SC): this component provides EBS functionality</li>
 			<li>Node Controller (NC): this component controls virtual machine instances</li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>In the Frontend+NC configuration, the CLC, Walrus, CC, and SC are installed on one machine, called
 			the Frontend. The NC is installed on another machine, called the Node. In this configuration you can have
 			one Frontend and one or more Nodes.</p>
		<p>In the Cloud-in-a-box configuration, all components are installed on one machine.</p>

 		<title>Hardware Requirements</title>
 		<p>Before installing FastStart in the Cloud-in-a-box configuration, make sure you have 
			a machine with:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>a minimum of 200GB of disk space</li>
 			<li>a minimum of 4GB of memory</li>
 			<li>at least one ethernet NIC</li>
 		</ul>

 		<p>Before installing FastStart in the Frontend+NC configuration, make sure you have 
			at least two machines with:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>a minimum of 100GB of disk space</li>
 			<li>a minimum of 4GB of memory</li>
 			<li>at least one ethernet NIC</li>
		</ul>
 		
 		<p>Test that each machine allows SSH login and that root access is available (sudo is okay).</p>

 		<title>Network Requirements</title>
 		<ul>
 		<li>You must have access to the internet.</li>
 		<li>You must be able to assign static IP addresses within your network.</li>
		<li>You must set aside a static IP address for each physical system.</li>
 		<li>You must set aside a range of available public IP addresses. Eucalyptus will assign these to VM instances.</li>
 		<li>You must set aside a large range of available private IP addresses.  These will be used by a virtual subnet. 
			They can not overlap or contain any part of a physical network IP address space.  Note: Eucalyptus will
			set aside, by default, the subnet 172.16.0.0 unless you choose to set different values.</li>
 		</ul>
		<p>A sample set of IP addresses might go as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>192.168.1.98 for the Frontend system</li>
			<li>192.168.1.99 for the first Node Controller</li>
			<li>192.168.1.100 for the second Node Controller</li>
			<li>192.168.1.101-192.168.1.149 for the public IP address range</li>
		</ul>

 		<title>Software Requirements</title>
 		<p>You must have access to the <b>Eucalyptus FastStart ISO</b>. You can get the FastStart ISO from <xref
 			href="http://www.eucalyptus.com/download/faststart" scope="external" 
			format="html">http://www.eucalyptus.com/download/faststart</xref>.  You should 
			then burn this ISO to a DVD.  This DVD will be used for installation on all physical machines
			in your cloud.</p>
