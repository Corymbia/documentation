      <title>Things You Need to Do to Get the Console Running</title>
      <p> In order to get the console working for your cloud, you will need to
        do the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modify the configuration file, as detailed in this section. At
          minimum, you must specify the <xref
            href="console_config_server_address.dita">front end address</xref>,
          and the <xref href="console_config_ui_port.dita">UI port</xref>. You
          should also be sure to specify the <xref
            href="console_config_cloud_admin_portal.dita">administrative support
            URL</xref> and the <xref href="console_config_admin_email.dita"
            >support URL</xref>.</li>
        <li>Configure Memcached. This is required for the eucaconsole service to use memcached on a single host.</li>
        <li>Create the user accounts using the Eucalyptus Administrative
          Console. For more information see the <xref
            href="../admin-guide/index.dita">Administration Guide</xref>.</li>
        <li>Make sure that any images that you would like users to be able to
          launch instances from are installed in your cloud; users can't add
          images from the Eucalyptus Console. </li>
        <li>Communicate the URL for your Eucalyptus Console installation to the
          users, and instruct them to use their account name, user name, and
          password to log in.</li>
      </ul>
