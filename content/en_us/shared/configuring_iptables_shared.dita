			<title>Restricting Network Access</title>
			<p>This section provides basic guidance on setting up a firewall
				around your Eucalyptus components. It is not intended to be
				exhaustive.</p>
			<p>On the Cloud Controller (CLC), Walrus, and Storage Controller (SC), allow for the following
				jGroups traffic:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections between CLC, user-facing services (UFS), object storage gateway (OSG),
					Walrus, and SC on port 8779 (or the first available port in range
					8779-8849)</li>
				<li>UDP connections between CLC, UFS, OSG, Walrus, and SC on port 7500</li>
				<li>Multicast connections between CLC, UFS, OSG, Walrus, and SC to IP 228.7.7.3 on UDP port
					8773</li>

			</ul>
			<p>On the UFS, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from end-users and instances on ports 8773</li>
				<li>End-user and instance connections to DNS ports</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the CLC, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from UFS, CC and Eucalyptus instances (public IPs) on port 8773 (for metadata service)</li>
				<li>TCP connections from UFS, OSG, Walrus, and SC on port 8777</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the CC, make sure that all firewall rules are
				compatible with the dynamic changes performed by Eucalyptus,
				described in the section below. Also allow the
				following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from CLC on port 8774</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On OSG, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from end-users and instances on port 8773</li>
				<li>TCP connections from SC and NC on port 8773</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On Walrus, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from OSG on port 8773</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the SC, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from CLC and NC on TCP port 8773</li>
				<li>TCP connections from NC on TCP port 3260, if tgt (iSCSI open
					source target) is used for EBS storage</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the NC, allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TCP connections from CC on port 8775</li>
				<li>TCP connections from other NCs on port 16514</li>
				<li>DHCP traffic forwarding to VMs</li>
				<li>Traffic forwarding to and from instances' private IP
					addresses</li>
			</ul>

			<title>Managing iptables Rules for the CC</title>
			<p>In Managed and Managed (No VLAN) modes, Eucalyptus flushes the
				CC's iptables rules for both <codeph>filter</codeph> and
					<codeph>nat</codeph>, then it sets the default policy for
				the <codeph>FORWARD</codeph> chain in <codeph>filter</codeph> to
					<codeph>DROP</codeph>. At run time, the CC adds and removes
				rules from <codeph>FORWARD</codeph> as users add and remove
				ingress rules from their active security groups. In addition,
				the <codeph>nat</codeph> table is configured to allow VMs access
				to the external network using IP masquerading, and dynamically
				adds/removes rules in the <codeph>nat</codeph> table as users
				assign and unassign public IPs to VMs at instance boot or
				run-time. </p>
			<p>If you have rules you want to apply on the CC, make the following
				edit on the CC before you start Eucalyptus or while Eucalyptus
				is stopped:</p>
			<codeblock>iptables-save > /etc/eucalyptus/iptables-preload</codeblock>
			<note type="caution">Performing this operation to define special
				iptables rules that are loaded when Eucalyptus starts could
				cause Eucalyptus VM networking to fail. We recommend that you
				only do this if you are completely sure that it will not
				interfere with the operation of Eucalyptus.</note>
