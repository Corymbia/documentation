 <title>Management Console Scaling Overview</title>
 <shortdesc>Cloud administrators can deploy the Eucalyptus Management Console in a cloud-compatible
  VM so that a console can scale to meet the demands of users and customers. Just as imaging, ELB,
  and workers are done currently, delivering the console inside an image provides the ability to
  eliminate work performed within the console itself.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Deploying the console this way allows only minor configuration of the console needed to launch an instance.
  </p>
  <p>The following are limitations that exist today. Deploying the console behing an ELB makes possible the following, 
   which are not possible otherwise:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>horizontal scalability</li>
   <li>isolated network environment with system-enforced network restrictions</li>
   <li>domain naming support for a fixed console endpoint (e.g., console.eucalyptus.subdomain.com)</li>
   <li>load balancing requests with ELB</li>
   <li>auto scaling based on console-controlled triggers</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
