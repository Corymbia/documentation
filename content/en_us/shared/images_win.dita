		<p>We recommend that you perform this task on a node controller (NC), or a host running the same
			Linux distributions and hypervisors as your NCs. If you are creating the Windows image
			on a machine currently running as a NC, terminate all running instances and stop the NC.
			To stop the NC, enter: </p>
		<codeblock>systemctl stop eucalyptus-node.service</codeblock>
		<p>A template file that closely matches those that Eucalyptus generates at VM instantiation time
			is located at
				<filepath>/usr/share/eucalyptus/doc/libvirt-kvm-windows-example.xml</filepath>. We
			recommend that you review the file to acquaint yourself with its contents, noting
			required files, bridges, and resources. For more information about configuring the
			libvirt.xml file, go to the <xref href="http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html"
				format="html">Domain XML format</xref> page in the libvirt documentation.</p>
