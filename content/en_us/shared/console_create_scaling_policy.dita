    <title>Create Scaling Policy</title>
    <shortdesc> An Auto Scaling policy defines how to perform scaling actions in response to CloudWatch
        alarms. Auto scaling policies can either scale-in, which terminates instances in your
        Auto Scaling group, or scale-out, which will launch new instances in your Auto Scaling
        group. For more information on Auto Scaling, please see <i>Using Auto Scaling</i> in
        the <i>Eucalyptus User Guide</i>. </shortdesc>

            <steps>
                <step>
                    <cmd>Type a name for the scaling policy in the <uicontrol>Name</uicontrol> text
                        box.</cmd>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <cmd>Select an action type using the <uicontrol>Action</uicontrol> control. The
                        action specifies what to do when a scaling condition is met.</cmd>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <cmd>Type the numerical unit for the scaling action in the
                            <uicontrol>Amount</uicontrol> text box. This value is used in
                        conjunction with the value entered in the <uicontrol>Measure</uicontrol>
                        control to determine how many instances to scale for this policy.</cmd>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <cmd>Select the measure for the scaling action using the
                            <uicontrol>Measure</uicontrol> control. This can be either a number of
                        instances (for example: 'scale up by 2 instances') or a percentage value
                        (for example: 'scale down by 10 percent').</cmd>
                </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>The cooldown period is the amount of time after the previous alarm-related scaling activity ends before new alarm-related scaling
                    activities can start. Use the <uicontrol>Cooldown period (seconds)</uicontrol> widget to specify a cooldown period.</cmd>

                    <note importance="normal">A CloudWatch alarm cannot be associated with more than
                        5 scaling policies.</note>
                    <cmd>Select a CloudWatch alarm from the <uicontrol>Alarm</uicontrol> control.
                        You can click the <uicontrol>Create Alarm</uicontrol> link to display the
                            <uicontrol>Create Alarm</uicontrol> dialog. Auto Scaling uses CloudWatch
                        alarms to determine when to take scaling actions.</cmd>
