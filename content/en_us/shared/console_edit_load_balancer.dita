    <title>Edit Load Balancer</title>
    <shortdesc> This wizard allows you to edit a load balancer. A load balancer allows you to
        automatically balance incoming traffic among a predefined group of instances, ensuring that
        requests are sent to an instance that has the capacity to serve them. For more information
        on load balancers, please see <i>Using Elastic Load Balancing</i> in the <i>Eucalyptus User
            Guide</i>.</shortdesc>
