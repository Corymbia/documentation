        <prereq><note>The Eucalyptus Management Console package is installed with the Eucalyptus
                repositories. The following instruction assumes that you're installing the console
                on a server that's already running Eucalyptus. If you're installing the console on a
                stand-alone machine, please see the <xref href="../install-guide/index.dita">Eucalyptus Installation Guide</xref> to set up
                the Eucalyptus repositories before following the instructions below.</note>
            <note importance="high">The version of the management console you're running should be
                the same as the version of Eucalyptus you're running. Running a management console
                against a Eucalyptus installation with a different version is unsupported.</note>
            <note importance="high">The Eucalyptus Management Console package will only install on 64-bit architectures.</note>
