    <title>Create IAM Roles</title>
    <shortdesc> Roles are used to temporarily allow users or services to access resources without sharing long-term security credentials.
    Permissions are applied to roles so they not attached to any IAM user or group, allowing applications or services (like Euca2ools) 
    to assume a role that allows them to make programmatic requests to Eucalyptus.</shortdesc>

                        Organize your roles in a way that makes sense to you, but ultimately, a path is not used to define how the role is applied.
