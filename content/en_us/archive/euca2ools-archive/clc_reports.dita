	<title>Reports Commands: CLC</title>
	<shortdesc/>
	<conbody>
		<p>This section contains reference information for reporting commands
			that use the Cloud Controller (CLC).</p>

		<p>Normally, you will just use <xref
				href="eureport-generate-report.dita"/> command. If you want to
			run reports against the data warehouse, you need to export data from
			the CLC using the <xref href="eureport-export-data.dita"/>
			command.</p>
		<note type="caution">Be careful if you use the
				<cmdname>eureport-delete-data</cmdname> command. Once you delete
			data from the CLC, you have to run reports using the data warehouse.
			You can't use the CLC for reporting.</note>
