		<p>You can create your own image if you to deploy an instance that is
			customized for your specific use. For example, you can create an EMI
			to deploy a LAMP server, MySQL database server, or a PostgreSQL
			database server. All you need is some familiarity with the creation
			process.</p>

			<title>About Linux Images</title>
			<p>A Linux image is a root partition of a Linux installation. We use
				the convention followed by EC2 images:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first partition is the root partition (where the EMI is
					attached)</li>
				<li>The second is the ephemeral partition (for additional
					storage)</li>
				<li>The third is the swap partition</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any image you create must conform to these conditions (for
				example, <filepath>/etc/fstab</filepath> must follow this
				convention). Typically, the disk provided by Eucalyptus (as well
				as EC2) is the first SCSI disk (sda). However, you can customize
				it to be, for example, the first IDE disk (hda) or the first
				virtual disk on a paravirtual machine (xvda). </p>

			<title>About Windows Images</title>
			<p>Eucalyptus supports a licensed version of Windows images. Before
				you bundle a Windows image, you must have a valid version of
				Windows OS installed on your hypervisor and the Eucalyptus
				Windows Integration Service installed in the created Windows VM.
				The following sections detail how to perform these tasks.</p>
			<p>Eucalyptus is compatible with images created from licensed
				versions of Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows
				Server 2008 R2, and Windows 7. Windows OS is sensitive to
				physical and virtual hardware changes made after installation.
				We recommend that you create any Windows image on the specific
				hypervisor (e.g., KVM) where you plan to run instances
				of that Windows image. Eucalyptus does not support running a
				Windows image across different hypervisors.</p>
			<p>Before you begin, you will need the following room for a blank
				disk file:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>8GB minimum, for Windows Server 2003 R2 (32-bit and
					64-bit)</li>
				<li>15GB minimum for Windows Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit),
					Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit), and Windows 7 (32-bit and
					64-bit)</li>
			</ul>
			<note type="tip">Eucalyptus implements ephemeral disks by which a
				running Windows instances are allocated an additional disk space
				based on the instance type. For example, if you assign an
				instance type 15 GB of disk and the registered Windows EMI is 8
				GB, 7 GB of disk spaces are ephemeral disks accessible under
					<filepath>D:\</filepath>. If your Windows application uses
				scratch space most of time, we recommend keeping the Windows EMI
				small because it takes longer to launch bigger EMIs.</note>
			<p>The windows image is a root file system that has no kernel and
				ramdisk associated with it. After creating your own Windows
				images, you can bundle, upload, and register it with
				Eucalyptus.</p>

			<title>Hypervisor and OS Information</title>
			<p>The following sections detail how to create an image based on the
				hypervisor and image OS you wish to use. To create an image
				using Windows, see <xref href="images_win.dita"/>. To create an
				image using Linux, see <xref
					href="images_lin.dita"/>.</p>
