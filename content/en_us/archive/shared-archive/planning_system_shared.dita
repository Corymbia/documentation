	<title>System Mode</title>
	<shortdesc>System mode is the simplest networking mode, but it also offers the smallest
		number of networking features.</shortdesc>

		<p>In this mode, Eucalyptus simply
			assigns a random MAC address to the VM instance before booting and
			attaches the VM instance's Ethernet device to the physical ethernet
			through the NC's bridge. Then, VM instances can obtain an IP address
			using DHCP, the same way any machine using DHCP would obtain an
			address. </p>
		<p>There is very little Eucalyptus configuration required to use System
			mode. Eucalyptus mostly stays out of the way in terms of VM
			networking. This mode requires a pre-configured DHCP server already
			active on the physical subnet. This server must be reachable by the
			machines hosting NC components. This mode is most useful for users
			who want to try out a simple Eucalyptus installation.</p>
		
		<section>
			<title>System Mode Requirements</title>
			<ul>
				<li>The physical Ethernet device on each NC that communicates
					with the CC must be bridged. </li>
				<li>A pre-existing DHCP server must be running and configured
					and reachable from the NCs.</li>
			</ul>

			<title>System Mode Limitations</title>
			<ul>
				<li>No elastic IPs </li>
				<li>No security groups</li>
