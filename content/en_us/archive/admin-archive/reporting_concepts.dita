	<title>Reporting Overview</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus lets you generate reports to monitor cloud resource use.
			Each type of report is for a specified time range. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Eucalyptus
			supports the following report types:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Instance:</b> The instance report provides information about
				the amount, duration, and utilization of all running instances.
				Use this report to understand how many instances each user is
				running, whether your instance types are large enough, etc. </li>
			<li><b>S3:</b> The S3 report provides information about the number
				of buckets and objects stored in Walrus. Empty buckets are not
				reported. Use this report to understand the storage needs of
				each user and your cloud's storage needs.</li>
			<li><b>Volume:</b> The volume report provides information about the
				amount, duration, and size of all volumes in use. Use this
				report to understand how many volumes are running, and what the
				storage size of each volume is. </li>
			<li><b>Snapshot:</b> The snapshot report provides information about
				the amount of your cloud's snapshots. Use this report to
				understand how many snapshots there are and from which volumes,
				and what the size of each snapshot is. </li>
			<li><b>Elastic IP:</b> The elastic IP report provides information
				about the lifecycle of elastic IPs in your cloud, including
				which user is using which IPs, which IPs are currently in use,
				and how often and for how long does IP get allocated. Use this
				report to understand how many IPs each user is assigned and to
				which instance the IP is assigned to, and the running time of
				each IP. </li>
			<li><b>Capacity:</b> The capacity report provides overall
				information about your cloud's resources, including instance
				types and storage. Use this report to determine if your
				resources are being used adequately, and whether you need to
				scale up or down.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You can generate reports in either CSV or HTML formats for use with
			external tools.</p>

		<section>
			<title>Understanding the Report Format</title>
			<p>All Eucalyptus reports contain a usage section. The instance
				report also contains a running time section.</p>
			<p>The usage section shows cumulative
				(<uicontrol>cumul.</uicontrol>) metrics for each zone, account,
				and user. Then the report lists metrics for each resource. The
				column for each resource type (for example, <uicontrol>Instance
					Id</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Volume Id</uicontrol> displays
					<uicontrol>cumul.</uicontrol> for all cumulative metrics.
				When individual resources are reported, the individual
				resource's name or identifier displays in that column.</p>
			
			
			<!--<p>For example, the instance report displays <uicontrol>cumul.</uicontrol> for the
 			<uicontrol>Instance Id</uicontrol> and the <uicontrol>Type</uicontrol> when reporting the
 			cumulative metrics for the zone, account, and user. Then, under the <uicontrol>User</uicontrol>
 			section, these columns display the specific identifier and type for each instance in use for the
 		user.</p>-->
