			<p>Eucalyptus lets you generate reports to monitor cloud resource
				use. Each type of report is for a specified time range.
				Eucalyptus supports the following report types. ou can generate
				reports for instances, volume, elastic IP, and compute.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Instances:</b> Shows a count and duration of instances
					running, sorted by image size, as well as I/O net and disk,
					during the date range specified. If desired, the report can
					be displayed on a per-user, per-account, per-cluster or
					per-availability zone basis. Once filtered, reports can be
					grouped using the same criteria as filters. For example, you
					might display the results by user, and then group the
					results so that they are displayed based on accounts, e.g.
					each user in account A is shown followed by each user in
					account B, etc.</li>
				<li><b>Volume:</b>
				</li>
				<li><b>Elastic IP:</b>
				</li>
				<li><b>Compute:</b>
				</li>
				<!--<li><b>Storage:</b>Shows GB of storage used (max and GB-days) for volumes and snapshots during the date range specified. Display filters and grouping are the same as for instances.</li>
        		<li><b>Walrus:</b> Shows maximum buckets and objects used through Walrus during the date range specified. Display filters and grouping are available on a per-user or per-account basis.</li>-->
			</ul>
			<p>You can generate reports in either CSV or HTML formats for use
				with external tools.</p>
