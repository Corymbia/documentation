    <title>Switch to the Stock DHCP Package</title>
    <shortdesc/>
    <taskbody>
        <context>This procedure is optional. However, Eucalyptus <ph
        	conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/> uses the stock DHCP server package. Prior to starting Eucalyptus services after upgrading packages, edit the configurations on each Cluster Controller (CC) and Node Controller (NC).
        <p>To edit the values in the CCs and NCs:</p>
        </context>
            <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Go to <codeph>/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.conf</codeph> and change the value of <codeph>VNET_DHCPDAEMON</codeph> from <codeph>/usr/sbin/dhcpd41</codeph> to <codeph>/usr/sbin/dhcpd</codeph>.</cmd>
            </step>
            	<step>
            		<cmd>Repeat on each CC and NC.</cmd>
            	</step>
            	<step>
                <cmd>After you have started all Eucalyptus services as described in the next
                	section, make sure that DHCP is functioning correctly. Make sure that instances are being assigned addresses from the DHCP server.</cmd>
                <info>        
                    <note type="tip">Not applying this change does not cause the cloud to
                    	malfunction. But Eucalyptus no longer maintains the existing
                    	<codeph>VNET_DHCPDAEMON</codeph> package. From this release on, Eucalyptus will already have the stock package applied.</note>
