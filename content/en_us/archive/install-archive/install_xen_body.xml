<section id="install_xen_body"><p>Before installing Eucalyptus, make sure that each NC server has a kernel with Xen support, and that this is a default kernel loaded at boot time.</p>
	<p>To determine the current kernel, enter the following command on an NC server:</p>
	<codeblock>uname -r | grep xen | wc -l</codeblock>
	<p>If the command returns a zero, the Xen kernel is either not installed or not setup correctly. You must install a Xen kernel.</p></section>
