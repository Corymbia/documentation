		<p>In <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_ha"/>, we recommend that you install no more
			than one Eucalyptus component on each physical server you plan to use.
			Eucalyptus is designed to run in any combination on the various physical servers. However, in
			order to make the best use of HA, we recommend that you give each component maximal local resource
			usage by installing a maximum of one component on each server. This allows for high performance
			and high availability. </p>
