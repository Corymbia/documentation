	<title>Managed (No VLAN) Mode</title>
	<shortdesc>In Managed (No VLAN) mode, Eucalyptus fully manages the local VM
		instance network and provides all of the networking features
		Eucalyptus currently supports, including security groups, elastic
		IPs, etc. However, it does not provide VM network isolation.</shortdesc>

		<p>Without
			VLAN isolation at the bridge level, it is possible in Managed (No
			VLAN) mode for a root user on one VM to snoop and/or interfere with
			the ethernet traffic of other VMs running on the same layer 2
			network.</p>
		<note type="tip">In Managed (No VLAN) mode, VM isolation is provided by
			having different security groups on different subnetsâ€”this
			translates into Layer-3 only VM isolation.</note>
		
		<section>
			<title>Managed (No VLAN) Mode Requirements</title>
			<ul>
				<li>There must be an available range of IP addresses for the
					virtual subnets. This range must not interfere with the
					physical network. Typically these IP addresses are selected
					from the private IP ranges: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, etc. </li>
				<li>Any firewall running on the Cluster Controller must be
					compatible with the dynamic changes performed by Eucalyptus
					when working with security groups. (Note that Eucalyptus
					will flush the 'filter' and 'nat' tables upon boot). </li>
				<li>A range of public IP addresses must be available for use by
					Eucalyptus. </li>
				<li>The CC must have a DHCP server daemon installed that is
					compatible with ISC DHCP Daemon version 3.0.X.</li>
				<li>If you plan to set up more than one cluster, you need to have a bridge for security groups
					to span the clusters.</li>
