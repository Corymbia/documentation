						<entry>Network traffic numbers in columns

							sample and deliver numbers to the reporting
							subsystem at different times. If the report is
							requested after the external counter is updated but
							before the total counter is updated, the numbers
							could appear out of their natural order. In a stable
							state without network traffic, the numbers will
							become correct eventually, usually within a few
