						<entry>When using VMware, all hosts must either be

							Mixed management of the hosts is not supported and

						<entry>If the <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> user does not
							have write access to the
								<filepath>/etc/eucalyptus</filepath> directory,
							the VMware Broker will stay in a
								<codeph>BROKEN</codeph> state, and
								<codeph>euca-configure-vmware</codeph> will
							fail. Run <codeph>chown -R eucalyptus:eucalyptus

						<entry>During a multiple instance migration the user may

						<entry>Performing a clean-restart operation during a

						<entry>The first attempt to run

						<entry>The <codeph>euca-bundle-instance</codeph> command
							defaults to the x86_64 architecture for both the NC

							disabled after an unexpected reboot (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4354"
								>EUCA-4354</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>This only occurs when CLC, Walrus, and SC are
							located on the same machine in an HA setting. In an
							unexpected reboot within that setting, when the
							redundant components switch roles, some secondary
							components can become initialized rather than
							disabled. For a workaround, restart the initialized
							components. We strongly recommend that you use one
							machine for each Eucalyptus component in HA
							mode.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>User console requires upload of private key to
							access a Windows instance password (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4293"
								>EUCA-4293</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>Passwords for Windows instances are encrypted for
							a specified key pair. The user console requires that
							you upload the appropriate private key to access an
							instance password. <b>We strongly recommend against
								using this feature without HTTPS!</b> To access
							the instance password without uploading your private
							key, use <codeph>euca-get-password [instance id] -k
								[keyfile]</codeph> on the command line.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>User console cannot generate new Windows password
							on restarting a stopped instance (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4291"
								>EUCA-4291</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>The user console continues to display an old
							password after a Windows instance is stopped and
							restarted. You must log out of the user console, log
							in again, and then generate a password, in order to
							log in to a Windows instance that has been stopped
							and restarted.</entry>

					<row>
						<entry>DBResourceCheck exceptions logged at
								<codeph>ERROR</codeph> log level (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4177"
								>EUCA-4177</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>The DBResourceCheck class frequently polls to
							determine the number of active database connections
							for a given alias. This can result in a
							DBResourceCheck exception. This exception is
							expected, and is not fatal.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>The reporting feature in the Eucalyptus
							Administrator Console show no metrics. (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4168"
								>EUCA-4168</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>This occurs only if you run a report that
							includes the current date. The metrics that show no
							data are: <uicontrol>CpuUsage%</uicontrol>,
								<uicontrol>Net Total In/Out</uicontrol>,
								<uicontrol>Disk R/W</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Disk
								IOPS R/W</uicontrol>, and
								<uicontrol>DiskTime</uicontrol>. For a
							workaround, use the CLI command,
								<apiname>eureport-generate-report</apiname>, to
							run reports from the Cloud Controller for a time
							period that includes the current date. You can also
							use the Eucalyptus Administrator Console and move
							the end date up the previous day.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>The <codeph>euca-describe-bundle-tasks</codeph>
							command does not keep task status after task
							completes (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4140"
								>EUCA-4140</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>When bundling a Windows instance, the task is
							removed from the task list as soon as the bundle
							completes, so euca-describe-bundle-tasks never shows
							a 'complete' status.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>[error:0290] message printed on upgrade (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4027"
								>EUCA-4027</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>The Eucalyptus upgrade process requires a large
							number of file descriptors, and an error may occur
							if <codeph>ulimit</codeph> is not set to an
							appropriate value. To avoid this error, set
								<codeph>ulimit -n 5000</codeph> before upgrading
							Eucalyptus. This error is not an indication of a
							failed upgrade.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Unable to start stopped instances after upgrade
								(<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4026"
								>EUCA-4026</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>Eucalyptus 3.2 manages ISCSI targets in a
							different way to previous versions. The first
							attempt to start any stopped instances relying on
								<codeph>iscsiadm</codeph> will fail, but the
							issue is resolved during cleanup so subsequent
							requests for that instance will work.</entry>

							bound (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-3909"

						<entry>The <codeph>httpd-cc_error_log</codeph> is not
							rotated and can grow quite large. To reduce this
							file size, do <codeph>cp /dev/null
								$EUCALYPTUS/var/log/eucalyptus/httpd-cc_error_log</codeph>.
							This will truncate the file. Removing the file is
							not recommended.</entry>

						<entry>If you are a subscriber and use NetApp as the
