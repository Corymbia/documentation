 <title>Eucalyptus Limitations and Restrictions</title>
 <shortdesc>This topic provides defaults used for known limitations and restrictions associated with
      <ph conref="../../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_longname"/> 4.4 features, services, and
    accounts as tested and supported by the Eucalyptus Quality Team. Some of these limitations may
    reflect the supported differences between AWS and Eucalyptus. </shortdesc>

  <section>
   <title>Functional Limitations</title>
   <p>This section describes features and operations that are not supported by Eucalyptus, and therefore,
   considered a functional limitation or difference from that of AWS. </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Eucalyptus CloudFormation Update Stack does not support Notification Configurations for given
     resources since Eucalyptus has not implemented Simple Notification Service (SNS) or Simple
     Queue Service (SQS).</li>
   <li>Eucalyptus CloudFormation Update Stack supports the <codeph>UpdatePolicy</codeph> attribute
     on the <codeph>AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup</codeph> type but only the
      <codeph>AutoScalingRollingUpdate</codeph> condition is supported since Eucalyptus Auto Scaling
     does not support Scheduled Actions.</li>
   <li>Full access to the Management Console requires a minimum IAM policy. See <xref
      href="../../shared/console_iam_policy.dita">Add Access Policy</xref> for the recommended
     minimal IAM policy to apply when creating a group.</li>
   <li>Auto scaling limits are aligned with the AWS limits, except for SNS topics, as SNS is
        currently not supported in Eucalyptus. The <xref
         href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_autoscaling"
         scope="external"
         format="html">AWS Auto Scaling Limits</xref> are also generally applicable to
        Eucalyptus.</li>
   <li>API support for object lifecycle in S3 is the same as for AWS S3 except for:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Glacier support</b>. There is no "transition" operation type to transition objects to Glacier.</li>
     <li><b>Transitions between storage classes</b>. Eucalyptus allows multiple storage classes but
       they have no real meaning and do not differentiate either cost or durability of the data. See
        <xref href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html"
        scope="external" format="html">AWS Object Lifecycle Management</xref> for more
       information.</li>
    </ul>

    <title>Configurable Limitations</title>
    <p>This section lists the limitations that are present for configuring certain resources, as tested by Eucalyptus,
     and may differ from those imposed by AWS. </p>
