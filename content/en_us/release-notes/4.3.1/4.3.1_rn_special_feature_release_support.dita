     <title>Upgrade Compatibility and Support Scope</title>
     <p>During the development of a special status feature, additional components may become
        available to the public for testing. Because special status features are still under
        development, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) cannot guarantee the stability of such
        features. As a result, if you are using special status features, you may not be able to
        seamlessly upgrade to subsequent <ph
          conref="../../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_longname"/> releases.</p>
     <p>Special status features are included in a release to provide early access to features that
        HPE may support fully in future releases, but HPE cannot guarantee that support will be
        provided or issues resolved in a future release. Some special status features may only be
        available for specific hardware architectures.</p>
     <p>The <ph conref="../../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_longname"/> customer success team may
        create bug reports on behalf of support cases filed by subscribed customers. These bug
        reports will then be forwarded to <ph
          conref="../../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_longname"/> engineering as proposed for
        inclusion in a future release.</p>

   <section id="tech_prev_definition">
    <title>Technology Preview Definition</title>
     <p>Technology preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling
       you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.</p>
     <p id="tech_prev_rules"><b>Customers and users should be aware that technology preview features:</b></p>
     <ul>
       <li>are not fully supported under HPE (formerly Eucalyptus Systems, Inc.) subscription level
          agreements.</li>
       <li>may not be functionally complete.</li>
       <li>are not intended for production use.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>In some cases, this may be applicable to the entire cloud deployment depending on the
       subsystems affected by the feature in technology preview. As HPE considers making future
       iterations of technology preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve
       any issues that customers experience when using these features.</p>

     <title>Controlled Availability Definition</title>
    <p>A controlled availability release is a conditional release of a product (or products) that
        does not meet a published standard, or for which HPE is unable to provide support under
        published policy.</p>
     <p id="control_avail_rules"><b>Customers and users should be aware that controlled availability features:</b></p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>are used to limit the shipment of a product or a release to a set of customers who agree
            to specific use conditions, which include migrating to a General Availability (GA)
            release when it is ready.</li>
        <li>are generally used to deliver early releases of new products or new features of existing
            products to satisfy customer commitments.</li>
        <li>might not include all time-critical fixes, although some defect repair might be rolled
            in as necessary.</li>
        <li>can be ordered only with proper approval and for a specified length of time. (The
            approval process and order start/stop time frame are documented prior to the release in
            the controlled availability agreement.)</li>
      </ul></p>
     <p>In some cases, this may be applicable to the entire cloud deployment depending on the
       subsystems affected by the feature in controlled availability. As HPE considers making future
       iterations of these features generally available, we will attempt to resolve
       any issues that customers experience when using these features.</p>
